*** Title Slide ***
*******************

Hi, my name is Matt Denny, I am a graduate student at Penn State
University, and today I am going to present some recent work
(with collaborators) on the relationship between gender and
patterns of communication among local government officials.

*************************
*** Research Question ***
************************* 

Our central research question centers on how the relationship
between gender and the pattern of communication varies across
the organizational domain, in local government.

By domain, I mean organizational function with which a
communication instance is concerned (e.g., long-range strategic
planning, human resource management, public relations, or simply 
whose team won the game last night.

*************************
*** Previous Research ***
*************************  

Previous research on gender in organizations has primarily
relied on administrative data, such as how much men and women
get paid, and the positions they hold in an organization, or
self reports of how employees experience the work place.

In addition to issues of limited scope, and the potential for
bias in these data, they also tell us very little about micro
level interactions between men and women in organizations.

********************************
*** Public Domain Email Data ***
********************************

We overcome the limitations of existing data sources for 
studying micro level interactions between men and women by
making use of a recently collected corpus of local government
email data.

************************************
*** County Government Email Data ***
************************************

Specifically, we make use of a cross-organizational county
government email data set collected by our lab, that
comprises all emails sent and received by department managers 
(eg. health, finance, HR and Emergency) in 17 North Carolina 
county governments durring overlapping 3 month periods in 2013.

This dataset comprises about 500,000 emails, of which 17,000 were sent by a department manager and include at least one other department manager in their county.

For the rest of the paper we limit our analysis to these emails, and only to emails sent between department managers in the same county. 

********************************************
*** County Government Email Data (Table) ***
********************************************

One reason we do this, is because we are able to collect metadata for all of the department managers in our sample, including gender and department affiliation. 

Notably, the gender composition of managers varies significantly across counties, as does the email volume.

*** Hypothesis ***
******************



*******************************************
*** Department-Dyad Regression Analysis ***
*******************************************



****************************
*** Female-Centric Dyads ***
****************************

So again in this table, departments highlighted in green are female dominated and and those highlighted in purple are male dominated. Each row represents a department-to-department dyad. 

This table displays the female centric rank orderings of gender mixing intercepts, and we do find support for our hypothesis that women will communicate more actively in domains that are female dominated. 

What this means is that the participation of female managers is amplified above and beyond their proportional representation. 

While this approach yields important insights, it does have one major limitation, in that it does not account for the content of the emails at all.
 
*******************************
*** Email Content as Domain ***
*******************************

To complement our analysis of department as domain, and to 
buttress some of its short-comings, we also make use of the 
email content (the words) as a proxy for the domain of 
communication. 

To do this, we make use of a statistical model recently 
developed (by our lab) for email data which allows us to 
jointly infer the topics discussed in an email and the 
interaction patterns associated with those topics of 
communication.

In this way, we are able to associate email content with 
gender mixing parameter estimates, to look for similar 
female-centric patterns of interaction based on content as 
opposed to department.

*****************************************
*** A Generative Model for Email Data ***
*****************************************

The model we use is a generative model. This means that we 
posit a statistical process by which the emails we observe 
were generated, and then invert this generative process to 
infer the parameters of interest from this process. 

For our model, we begin by generating two sets of global 
variables. 

The first of these are "topics" (which have the meaning you 
might expect),  and which are operationalized as distributions 
over words that relate to some concept.

These topics are then associated to some smaller number of 
interaction patterns. 

These interaction patterns specify the probability that for a 
given email sender, each potential alter is selected as a 
recipient, following a logistic regression form. This probability is controlled by three parameters:

1. An intercept parameter that controls the general propensity 
for people to send emails to each other in this interaction 
pattern.
2. A set of covariate parameters which (in our case) control the propensity for authors of each gender to include recipients of each gender. 
3. A distance between actors in a space of latent variables, where authors are more likely to include recipients who are closer  to them in this space, and less likely to include those who are more distant.

In this way our model could generate emails where some topics 
are discuss more frequently and some and following different 
gendered patterns of interaction than others.

********************************************
*** A Generative Model for Email Data: 2 ***
********************************************

After generating the global parameters, our model then 
generates the individual emails. 

First we draw the content of the email following the 
generative process for latent Dirichlet allocation, where each email is its own distribution over topics, from which we draw the actual words.

Then, we draw the actual recipients for the email parameterized by a mixture of interaction patterns, conditional on the degree to which topics associated with them are represented in the email.

In this way, our model links latent Dirichlet allocation and the latent space network model.

*********************************
*** Specification and Methods ***
*********************************

We perform Bayesian inference in this model using Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods. I can discuss our inference procedure further in Q and A, or please see our paper if you are interested.

*** Example Model Output ***
****************************

Lets begin by looking at some example model output. 

So again in this table, topic labels highlighted in purple are male dominated and each row represents a topic.

**********************************************
*** Female-Centric Topics of Communication ***
**********************************************

So again in this table, topic labels highlighted in green are female dominated and each row represents a topic.
