*** Title Slide ***
*******************

Hi, my name is Matt Denny, I am a graduate student at Penn State
University, and today I am going to present some recent work
(with collaborators) on the relationship between gender and
patterns of communication among local government officials.

*************************
*** Research Question ***
************************* 

Our central research question centers on how the relationship
between gender and the pattern of communication varies across
the organizational domain, in local government.

By domain, I mean organizational function with which a
communication instance is concerned (e.g., long-range strategic
planning, human resource management, public relations, or 
simply whose team won the game last night.

*************************
*** Previous Research ***
*************************  

Previous research on gender in organizations has primarily
relied on administrative data, such as how much men and women
get paid, and the positions they hold in an organization, or
self reports of how employees experience the work place.

In addition to issues of limited scope, and the potential for
bias in these data, they also tell us very little about micro
level interactions between men and women in organizations.

********************************
*** Public Domain Email Data ***
********************************

We overcome the limitations of existing data sources for 
studying micro level interactions between men and women by
making use of a recently collected corpus of local government
email data.

************************************
*** County Government Email Data ***
************************************

Specifically, we make use of a cross-organizational county
government email data set collected by our lab, that
comprises all emails sent and received by department managers 
(eg. health, finance, HR and Emergency) in 17 North Carolina 
county governments durring overlapping 3 month periods in 2013.

This dataset comprises about 500,000 emails, of which 17,000 
were sent by a department manager and include at least one 
other department manager in their county.

For the rest of the paper we limit our analysis to these 
emails, and only to emails sent between department managers in 
the same county. 

********************************************
*** County Government Email Data (Table) ***
********************************************

One reason we do this, is because we are able to collect 
metadata for all of the department managers in our sample, 
including gender and department affiliation. 

Notably, the gender composition of managers varies 
significantly across counties, as does the email volume.


****************************************
*** Department Affiliation as Domain ***
****************************************

One potential proxy for the domain of communication among 
county managers is their department affiliation. For example, 
we might expect department communication dyads involving the 
finance manager to fall under the domain of the budget or 
requisitions.

However, because we often only observe one or two managers 
with a particular department affiliation within each county, 
we cannot make inferences about the relationship between 
gender and department within individual counties. Fortunately, 
we observe different gender-department combinations across our 
sample, so we leverage this cross-county variation in our 
study.

**********************************************
*** Individual Department Gender Breakdown ***
**********************************************

To do this, we first hand code department titles given in the 
county directories into one of 25 different groups. 

If we look at the gender break down of managers in our sample 
across all counties, we can see that some department manager 
positions (columns highlighted in purple) are heavily 
dominated by male managers, while other positions are female 
dominated. 

It is also important to note that not every department is 
represented in every county. 

******************
*** Hypothesis ***
******************

This leads us to consider a hypothesis about these 
communication patterns that derives from a recently published 
article which found experimentally that women communicate at a 
rate even higher than their representation, in groups where 
they are in the majority, and that being the majority 
represented a critical tipping point.

Our hypothesis is that women will communicate at an increased 
rate (above and beyond their representation) in female 
dominated organizational domains. 

*******************************************
*** Department-Dyad Regression Analysis ***
*******************************************

To test this hypothesis using department affiliation as a 
proxy for domain, we specify a series of Poisson regressions 
predicting the number of emails sent between managers of each 
gender within a particular department-dyad, across counties. 

For example, there might be some counties where we have a male 
finance manager and female health manager, and vice versa. 

To perform our test we specify two models for each 
department-dyad. The first of these is a model with a single 
intercept capturing the propensity of managers in a particular 
department to include managers of the other department on 
their emails, regardless of gender.

The second model is a gender model with a separate intercept 
for each gender pairing.

For our analysis, we only consider those department dyads for 
which at least one observation of each gender combination is 
present, and we perform a LR test to determine whether the 
gender model fits better. 

In 70% of cases, the gender model does provide a significantly 
better fit and we now look at rank orderings of these gender 
mixing coefficients to see if we find a pattern of departments 
represented in the female-centric rank orderings of these 
parameters (indicating women send more emails than men, and 
both men and women are more likely to include women as 
recipients of their emails).


****************************
*** Female-Centric Dyads ***
****************************

So again in this table, departments highlighted in green are 
female dominated and and those highlighted in purple are male 
dominated. Each row represents a department-to-department 
dyad. 

This table displays the female centric rank orderings of 
gender mixing intercepts, and we do find support for our 
hypothesis that women will communicate more actively in 
domains that are female dominated. 

What this means is that the participation of female managers 
is amplified above and beyond their proportional 
representation. 

While this approach yields important insights, it does have 
one major limitation, in that it does not account for the 
content of the emails at all.
 
*******************************
*** Email Content as Domain ***
*******************************

To complement our analysis of department as domain, and to 
buttress some of its short-comings, we also make use of the 
email content (the words) as a proxy for the domain of 
communication. 

To do this, we make use of a statistical model recently 
developed (by our lab) for email data which allows us to 
jointly infer the topics discussed in an email and the 
interaction patterns associated with those topics of 
communication.

In this way, we are able to associate email content with 
gender mixing parameter estimates, to look for similar 
female-centric patterns of interaction based on content as 
opposed to department.

*****************************************
*** A Generative Model for Email Data ***
*****************************************

The model we use is a generative model. This means that we 
posit a statistical process by which the emails we observe 
were generated, and then invert this generative process to 
infer the parameters of interest from this process. 

For our model, we begin by generating two sets of global 
variables. 

The first of these are "topics" (which have the meaning you 
might expect),  and which are operationalized as distributions 
over words that relate to some concept.

These topics are then associated to some smaller number of 
interaction patterns. 

These interaction patterns specify the probability that for a 
given email sender, each potential alter is selected as a 
recipient, following a logistic regression form. This 
probability is controlled by three parameters:

1. An intercept parameter that controls the general propensity 
for people to send emails to each other in this interaction 
pattern.
2. A set of covariate parameters which (in our case) control 
the propensity for authors of each gender to include 
recipients of each gender. 
3. A distance between actors in a space of latent variables, 
where authors are more likely to include recipients who are 
closer  to them in this space, and less likely to include 
those who are more distant.

In this way our model could generate emails where some topics 
are discuss more frequently and some and following different 
gendered patterns of interaction than others.

********************************************
*** A Generative Model for Email Data: 2 ***
********************************************

After generating the global parameters, our model then 
generates the individual emails. 

First we draw the content of the email following the 
generative process for latent Dirichlet allocation, where each 
email is its own distribution over topics, from which we draw 
the actual words.

Then, we draw the actual recipients for the email 
parameterized by a mixture of interaction patterns, 
conditional on the degree to which topics associated with them 
are represented in the email.

In this way, our model links latent Dirichlet allocation and 
the latent space network model.

*********************************
*** Specification and Methods ***
*********************************

We perform Bayesian inference in this model using Markov chain 
Monte-Carlo methods. I can discuss our inference procedure 
further in Q and A, or please see our paper if you are 
interested.
