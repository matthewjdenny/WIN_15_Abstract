\section{Gender in Organizations}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Gender bias in organizations is well documented in terms of pay, prestige, position, and social interaction. 
	\item Gender equity is normatively important.
	\item Scholars have sought to understand the roots, extent, and nature of gender bias, but have not had access to primary source data. This has traditionally been observational, ethnographic and self reports, which can be biased. Limited in scope. 
	\item With the increasing use of electronic communication, and the rise of e-government/ transparency, we are now able to use government email to study gender bias using primary source data.
	\item This also makes our analyses replicable. 
	\item Therefore, we choose to explore the relationship between gender and communication patterns in government organizations. 
	% gender in govt organizations has been studies before pulbic vs. private. 
	\item To do this, we collect and analyze large scale email data from a sample of 17 local governments.  
	\item What do we look for, how do we do it,  what do we find -- at a high level. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item North Carolina has robust public records laws which let us collect data.
	% \item We did this as part of a transparency-by-conformity field experiment. Make sure to spell out what we do.
	\item 22 complied with our request but only 17 counties did so in a way that  was  useful to our research, allowing us to compare across organizations.
	\item Provide some descriptive statistics of the data.

\section{Descriptive Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item We want to see if there is a relationship between sender gender and recipient gender.
	\item If we want to know about gendered patterns of communication in organizations, we should start by looking at aggregate statistics by gender:
	
	
	\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{m{2in}rrr}
		\toprule
	& \textbf{Male} & \textbf{Female}  \\
		 \midrule
		 Proportion of Managers & 61.6\%& 38.4\% \\
		 \midrule
		 Average \# Emails Sent & 48.3 & 51 \\
		 Average \# Recipients Per Email Sent & 1.45 & 1.43 \\
		 \midrule
		 Average \# Emails Received & 70.8 & 71.6 \\
		\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{\label{tab:email agg stats}Manager email statistics by gender.}
	\end{table}
	
	
	% make this a contingency table and do a chi squared test
	\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
		\toprule
	& \textbf{Male Recipient} & \textbf{Female Recipient}  \\
		 \midrule
		 Female Sender & 62.2\% & 37.8\% \\
		 Male Sender & 60.7\% & 39.3\%  \\
		\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{\label{tab:email agg stats}Manager email statistics by gender.}
	\end{table}
	
	\item The gender split is 60\% men, 40\% women and they both send and receive a comparable number of emails on average, so no volume difference.
	\item Male and female managers also do not communicate with their own gender at a higher rate. 
	
	\item We have replicated previous research, we don't see gender bias, we could stop here but because we have more information we are going to dig deeper.
	
	\item No gender bias? One place the literature tells us to look for gender bias is in the roles/positions in the organization.

	\end{figure}
	% use recipeint rather than receiver and flip the y axis. omit zeros. have the shading march along together
	
	\item We can see that some departments are mostly men -- the county manager (the boss), the sheriff, and the emergency manager, for example. Others are mostly women -- the HR, finance, health, for example. 
	\item So there is some evidence of gendering in positions, but what about men and women who perform the same position? We can form a contingency table that records the number of emails sent by each gender combination against every department communication dyad.
	% \item Lets look at an example of finance managers because every county has one. First off, there are only two female county managers and the finance managers in their counties are both women, so we focus instead on counties with male managers. Of these 15 counties, 10 have a female finance manager and 5 have a male finance manager. How do they communicate with the county manager?

Out of 15 counties with a male county manager, 10 had female finance managers and 5 had male finance managers. The (Fraction) displayed under each percentage is the raw number of emails sent to that manager divided by the total number of emails sent, aggregated over counties. }
% 	\end{table}
%
% 	\item Male county managers do not communicate preferentially with finance managers of either gender, so no evidence for biased treatment by supervisor within positions in this case.
% 	\item However, female finance managers are sending lots more emails on average (168) than their male counterparts (62), even though they send the same number to the county manager. Remember that on average, men and women send the same number of emails, so it is not just that women use email more in general. So are their job responsibilities different?
% 	\item To understand this, we need to look at email content -- what are male and female managers talking about?
% 	\item A quick and dirty way to start is by searching for things like question marks, exclamation points, and "Thanks" to see if we observe differences by gender.
	
	
	% # female finance managers send male county managers 20.5% (334/1628) of emails
	%   # male finance managers send male county managers 48.4% (151/312) of emails
	%   # male county managers send female finance managers 24.2% (372/1535) of emails
	%   # male county managers send male finance managers 21.2% (182/859) of emails

% 	\end{table}
%
% 	\item We do see significant differences, but why? Is this because men and women use language differently to accomplish the same goals, or because gender plays a role in the tasks managers are asked to do?
	
	\item If we want to do this in a more principled way, and for all departments at once, we might want to use a topic model to categorize emails, then look at gender mixing using the LSM in each topic.
	
	\item However, the gender mixing parameters we infer using this approach would be confounded by selection effects. As a toy example, we would not be able to tell whether men prefer to talk to male coworkers over female coworkers about football, or women prefer not to talk about football at work, and so they do not participate in those conversations. 
	\item To disentangle these effects, we need a joint model for email topical content, and the structure of communication.
\end{enumerate}

\section{A Model of Email Content}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Motivation for building a model for email data -- who you send an email to depends on what it is about. And what you say depends on who you are talking to. 
	\item Our solution: a generative model for email topics and recipients. Then discuss the existing TPME model and why we build on it. 
	\item Overview of the generative process in plain english.
	\item Describe the generative process for LDA part of model.
	\item Model based topic clustering.
	\item Explain how draws of message recipients are conditioned on the email topics. 
	\item Describe the generative process for the latent space portion of model.
	\item Summarize the generative process and lead into inference. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inference}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We have to invert the generative process to perform inference on the model parameters.
	\item We use block Metropolis Hastings within Gibbs sampling.
	\item A beta R package is available for those interested.
	\item Discuss our model specification and justify our hyper-parameter choices.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Gender Mixing}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Since we have modeled content and structure together, we have broken up the confounding we were concerned about, and we can now interpret the gender mixing parameters that come out of our model with more confidence.
	
	\item Lets return to the question we posed at the end of our descriptive analysis section: Are women being excluded from conversations by their male coworkers, or are they simply not discussing the same things via email?
	
	\item  Lets form some expectations about the relationship between gender mixing parameters we estimate. 
	
	\item If we observe a positive relationship between the female-female mixing parameters and the male-female or female-male mixing parameters we estimate, this is evidence that there are male and female topics, and if you want to talk about a female (male) topic, you send an email to a female (male) colleague. This is evidence for the gendering of communication content. As a toy example, if you want to email about football, you email a male colleague.
	
	\item If we observe a negative relationship, this is evidence that there are some things that men send or receive emails about, and some things women send or receive emails about. This is evidence for gender bias in organizational roles.

		\end{tabular}
	\end{figure}
	
\item We observe a pattern that is consistent with a gendering of communication content.	
	
	
\end{enumerate}



% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Here, we test whether larger organizations exhibit less gender bias, which is something that \cite{Huffman2010} found using longitudinal data from the Employment Opportunity Commission on occupational status and pay.
% 	\item The key benefit of using our model in this context: we remove the confounding effect of what is being talked about on the relationship between gender mixing and organization size. For example, it could be that in aggregate, differences in gender mixing across counties are only be related to differences in how those organizations use email. Some might use email for more informal communication (\citep{Ibarra1992} found that informal communication is more homophilous) while others use it for more formal communication, leading to a difference in gender mixing that is unrelated to organization size.
% 	\item Display plots.
% 	\item Discuss our results, which indicate that cross-gender communication is most likely in mid-sized organizations.
