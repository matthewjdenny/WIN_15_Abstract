We need more theory building work.

â€” more theory from existing work, generate new theory 

borrow a lot of the judicial paper's methods.

gendered communication makes us think about the different ways that people talk as opposed to whether they talk

Use sentiment.

dis-agregate from department level.

On issue of topics talk more about them -- need to filter top words.

women tend to take jobs the require more interaction.  

men tend to use more procedural language.

Research shows women produce and consume text faster than men, should look at timing.

Need more theory and need to tie the theory into the data better.

They thought that gendered communication was going to be about diffs. in the way men and women speak.

If we were to study the WAY men/women speak, we could use sentiment analysis -- might be gender differences.

Are our results driven by the fact that these departments are male/female driven. Is it that the only person people have to talk about finance with are women so that's just driving the results? This is different than people *choosing* to email a man/woman.

Need to do more stopword removal (e.g., months, days of the week).

Can we study power dynamics?

Do women write emails to me differently to men write emails to women.

Maybe women are more likely to take communicative jobs. Finance and HR -- these departments send and receive a lot of email. So maybe what we're seeing is just a reflection of that.

Can we dig into causal reasons for why men/women are in diff. positions. 

Could use personnel changes to dig into whether there are changes to communication (i.e., more/less communication with men/women) when there are personnel changes.

Who initiates email threads? Men? Women?
